NetModelingFramework
====================

A framework to support meta-modeling and modeling under .NET (Ã  la EMF).

It can be used on its own or be integrated with Antlr. In the latter case metamodel classes are generated for each Antrl rule, as well as a wrapper around the original Antlr parser, so that a NMF model is obtained, instead of a Antlr AST.
